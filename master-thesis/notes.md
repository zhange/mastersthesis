Prove:

- I speculate that the overall number of models produced on OASIS will be quantitatively larger and from a broader range of users.

- I hypothesize that if OASIS is publicized to users online, then anonymous online users will construct models in our sketching interface and create daylight renderings for analysis.

We did not have time to go over this...mention in chap5
- As mentioned before we also collect passive data.
Specifically, we collect how long users spend on each page of our interface and how long users wait for both physical sketch interpretations and daylight renderings.

no demonstrates!

discuss what changed in my prorities of OASIS implemenation from

Overall, the main take away from participant feedback concerning design limitations is that doors are essential to communicate to users that our sketching interface supports multi room designs.

===================================================
===================================================
Present and discuss the main findings of your research

#GOOD
	- If put online, ppl use OASIS (FGM)
		> Promising for research via FGM

#BAD
	- Many register, few use (FGM)
		(why) cost of doing buisness
		> cruital if your FGM requires general users
		> important because you want to find your vested users

	- Many novinces not enogh experts(main goal) (FGM)
		> postive result if your FGM requires general users
		> negative if your results require vested users

	- Hard to advertise on online bulletin forms (FGM)
		(why) popularity goes down quickly
		> cruital if your FGM requires general users
		> cruital because you want to find your vested users

	- Few urs gve fdbk rltve 2 tolts urs (FMG)
		(why) could be cost of doing bueiness
		> cruital if your FGM requires general users
		? Vested users == users who will return + give feedback.
			qed they would not be in this sit

	- Ambgs fdbk mks it hrd to anlyze (FGM)
		> ineffiecntly in the FGM, could lead to bad design choices

	- Seems to be a strong demand for doors (ARC)
		- Doors == Multiroom
		> If you give people a sketching interface without doors, aparently they think you can't draw rooms anymore... thats just plain old neat! People are broken!

	- Not enough people spend time on last tab (DYL)
		(why) Might be having diffuiltiy getting to last tab
		(why) Lose intrest along the way, no goal
		(why) Models don't work
		(why) Not understand what to do at tab, 
		(expectations) maybe our visualizations are quick enough that poeople don't need too much time to sit back and appriciate...
			Models = homework programs
			Daylight issues = compilations error
			you wouldn't spend hours looking at error, you'd just back to your code once you read the error.
		> depends on the why in this case
	- Furniture selection limited design (DYL)
	 	> People might what to use our interface but this limiation on design could prevent them from using it.

===================================================

# FGM requires you find a select number of returning users with enough vested intrest to drive the FGM!
	- Vested users

# FGM requires to much overhead if used for the general audiance. You would have to keep luring them back in + continoual advertizement
	- General users


- Software design as an interative design process
	- OASIS is an experment in that
	- Prevent researchers from working in vaccum
	- Helps make important contrubtions that will matter to people.

 - As a feedback design machine important to remove ambigious feedback

# Who is this targeted to?
	- future with acustics and other simulations
		- architects in early design phase
		- unintented users
			- acoustics
				- might get music junkies looking to fix audio qual in their room
			- thermal
				- similar
	- right now w/ daylighting 
		- archies intrested in sustainability
			- experts
		- people with exisiting spaces who want to arrange their furinture in some way
			- noobs

Implications of findings
Limitations of the research
Recommendations for future work




any other limitations?
are limitations things that we did not do yet?

or are limitations things that limited us?
	* Going with the second.

	positive and encouraging

	Our current daylighting simulation tool does not output
a measurement of the daylighting effectiveness (e.g., daylight autonomy). We plan to
implement and visualize these metrics in future work

Complex daylighting metrics including glare could be calculated for usersâ€™ geometries

 Our daylighting simulation and projection system is currently limited to diffuse
material properties and clear glass

Although feedback from novice user is helpful in evaluating some elements of OASIS, we require feedback from experienced users to make large design choice pertaining to architectural analysis.

Chapter Summary Notes
=====================
We had people use our tool
It was encouraging b/c feedback guides designing
interesting experiment in participant driven feature design

Issue with large number of users leaving without trying it out + use our tool without feedback.
We need more expert users to drive OASIS development
Novice feedback helpful with UI choices
Such as doors

Better word our feedback questions

Overall it was insightful


Future work to do as particicpent drive feature design

Future work on sketching interface

Future work on daylight

OASIS looks promising as participant driven feature thingy + hopes that this tool might one day save someone $$$ and time on architectrual projects.
