\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}

I would like to thank my thesis adviser, Dr. Barbara Cutler, for her thoughtful advice, experience, and feedback throughout the creation of this thesis. I would like to thank my lab mates Max Espinoza, Sensen Chen, Jim Olyha, and Jeramey Tyler for their helpful suggestions and criticism of my work. I would also like to thank all of my friends I've met at RPI, for they've made my experience here all the more worthwhile. Finally, I'd like to thank my parents, Weixian Zhang and Popo Chan, for their unwavering support throughout my education, for without them none of this would be possible.
